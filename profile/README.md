# Welcome to HSEARL

## Overview

HSEARL is a collective term for the frameworks and technologies used to construct human-like entities in a digital space.

This project aims to provide a formal specification for modeling the following elements with a focus on solving pure tasks in human activities:

-   **Cognitive Architecture**: Memory systems, attention mechanisms, decision-making processes.
-   **Motivational Dynamics**: Need hierarchies, goal pursuit, behavioral adaptation.
-   **Interaction with the Environment**: Context-dependent responses and ecological constraints.
-   **Temporal Evolution**: Learning, development, and state transitions over time.

While we encourage freedom in the approaches to replicate human-like behavior, please understand that this project is focused on practical task resolution. We are not interested in the academic or philosophical debates about "what it means to be human."

## Who is this for?

-   Anyone involved with or interested in AI.
-   Anyone interested in digitally recreating human-like entities.

## How to Get Involved
